#======== Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family ===================
'''


Create a class called TheIncredibles. This class should inherit from the Family class:
This is no random family they are an incredible family, therefore the members attributes, will be a list of dictionaries containing the additional keys : power and incredible_name. (See Point 4)

Add a method called use_power, this method should print the power of a member only if they are over 18 years old. If not raise an exception (look up exceptions) which stated they are not over 18 years old.

Add a method called incredible_presentation which :

    Print a sentence like ‚Äú*Here is our powerful family **‚Äù
    Prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details (ie. use the super() function, to call the family_presentation method)
