#======================= ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Dogs ======================

#Create a class called Dog.
# class Dog : 
#     def __init__(self, name, height):  #in this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
#         self.name = name

#         print(f'Name is {name} and height is {height}')

#============== ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3 : Whoâ€™s the song producer? ===========
'''
Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.

'''
# class Song():
#     def __init__(self,lyrics = []):
#         self.lyrics = lyrics

#     def sing_me_a_song(self):
#         for each_element in self.lyrics:
#             print(each_element)

# stairway= Song(["Thereâ€™s a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and sheâ€™s buying a stairway to heaven"])
# stairway.sing_me_a_song()

#============== Exercise 4 : Afternoon at the Zoo ===============
'''
Create a class called Zoo.
In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isnâ€™t already in the list.
Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.

Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
