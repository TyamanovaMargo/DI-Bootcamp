Unsupervised machine learning algorithms find hidden patterns and data without any human intervention, i.e., we don’t give output to our model.

        "**Feature Selection** is the process of identifying the most relevant features (variables) from the dataset that will be used to train the model. This stage involves data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data, followed by methods like correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis) to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features. The goal is to improve model performance and reduce complexity by focusing on the most significant features. For instance, in predicting house prices, relevant features might include square footage and number of bedrooms, while irrelevant features like the house color can be discarded.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Selection** is the stage where the most suitable machine learning algorithm is chosen based on the problem type and data characteristics. The decision depends on whether the task is classification or regression. Common models include linear regression for continuous outcomes, decision trees or random forests for both classification and regression, and neural networks for complex datasets like images. Hyperparameter tuning, using methods such as grid search, is also performed to optimize the model's performance. For example, a logistic regression model might be used for binary classification tasks like predicting whether an email is spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluation** assesses the model's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well and doesn’t overfit or underfit the training data. This stage typically involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, often with cross-validation to evaluate the model’s performance on different subsets of the data. The evaluation uses metrics appropriate for the task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification, or mean squared error and R-squared for regression. After training a decision tree to predict customer churn, these metrics help determine how well the model predicts new customer behavior."
